# ToDo-app-Django-Project




It's my first Django project. A basic app - that has user login, logout and registration system. Once the user has successfully logged in, he can add his own to-do list with ease, edit, delete and strike the list out when done. The app also has an 'About' page which gives app's description in brief.
